          My first "serious" IDE for the web was something called Aptana - basically an Eclipse with some cool additions
          for web development. It had its own JRE in a folder - I could just put it on my 2GB USB flash drive and use it
          everywhere without installing Java. Big deal. On a flash drive it was next to my manually configured
          "portable" Apache, and a portable version of Chrome. And before Aptana I have used Dreamweaver, I did not know
          how to HTML much, and dreamweaver was a WYSIWYG thing. Tweaking what dreamweaver produced was how I learnt
          HTML and CSS.

          All one had to do to deploy a website is upload the updated files via FTP. Fancy IDEs had FTP built in - one
          just had to click a button to sync with an FTP. There was no CI/CD, no one used VCS. Later, SVN prevailed.
        </li>
        <li>
          XSS was a thing. It still <a href="https://aszx87410.github.io/beyond-xss/en/">is</a>, but web is a way safer
          place now. Everything had to be done with meticulous care. Sanitizing input for databases was not a common
          thing - there were no prepared statements. CORS was not a thing, too. JSONP was.
        </li>
        <li>
          There was no such thing as Developer Tools. So people used FireBug back then. In Opera I used FireBug Lite,
          that loaded via bookmarklet. In order to debug CSS blocks - I used to write
          <code>*{ border: 1px solid red; }</code>.
        </li>

          It was typical to hand-code things. Template engines were not a thing. PHP was mainly used to not repeat
          yourself, to include headers/sidebars/footers, but pages were usually hand-coded. Later, it become typical to
          write own CMS to edit these html pages (via simple text field with html in it, and later with some WYSIWYG
          like CKEditor and TinyMCE). On free-lance market everyone had his own tiny CMS, because "big" CMSs were hard
          to set up and they required a database, and database required maintenance, migration, backups and all that.
          Databases were usually hosted to have a forum. Forums were a thing, blogs were not. Later, it become common to
          make "web portals" for everything, that had forum, blog, gallery, guestbook and a flash clock in its sidebar.

          What came from a designer was often either a single PSD file or.. a single JPEG file. Webmaster often had to
          slice them manually. If the designer was tech-savvy - the design came already sliced, in an HTML table. A
          webmaster, the "markup guy" was a thing, "front-end developer" was not.
        </li>
        <li>
          IE5 and IE6 had support for PNG, but to enable that one had to add
          <code>progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader</code> filter to the image style. And had to do that
          via JavaScript, because that also required the image source.
        </li>

          was huge. It allowed to mitigate IE5/6 box model issues. The idea is that different browsers handled CSS
          differently, and in IE there was a bug that allowed to target IE only. Also, in IE one had to write
          <code>position: relative; zoom: 1</code> - it fixed a lot of issues with alpha and whatnot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Working with SVG was a pain across browsers. Everybody used a library called
          <a href="https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael">RaphaÃ«l.js</a>, it was the only reliable way to
          manipulate/create SVGs. Nowadays it become
          <a href="https://github.com/adobe-webplatform/Snap.svg">Snap.svg</a>, but it is not as popular because SVG is
          now cross-browser and reliable.
        </li>
        <li>
          1px.gif, used to create spacers, to have margins consistent. Mainly because of IE, that did not display table
          cell if it was empty, so had to put something there, and non-breaking space took too much space (it is still a
          thing in email clients, btw). Also, IE handled margins weirdly, so to have a consistent, explicitly defined
          margin we used an &lt;img/&gt; tag with 1px transparent gif in it and width/height set explicitly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pixel-perfect markup was largely a thing. Clients demanded their websites to look exactly like the PSD they
          were made from. It was way harder to do than it is now, but now there is less demand for that.
        </li>
        <li>
          960.gs was a thing! It helped a lot with the layout, before the bootstrap become popular. Later, I've seen a
          lot of websites using bootstrap for its grid only.
        </li>
        <li>
          There was times when <code>border-radius</code> was not supported by browsers. Before chrome, before prefixes
          - only opera had it. So to do border radius and a shadow it had to be done via 2 extra divs and 4 images.
          <code>border-image</code> was not a thing either. For some reason designers were obsessed with rounded corners
          back then, so it was a must. On an interview it was a common thing to ask a candidate about round corners.
        </li>
        <li>Paid browsers were a thing. Free version of Opera showed a huge banner on top of its interface.</li>
        <li>
          Cufon and sIFR were a thing. Sometimes designers wanted to use a fancy font or two, and client insisted. But
          there was no <code>@font-face</code> yet. Cufon allowed to load and render custom fonts using JS (after canvas
          became a thing) and sIFR allowed to do that using flash (before canvas). Also, cufon allowed text to have
          shadows and other stuff, not possible via CSS back then.
        </li>
        <li>
          Everybody's page 404 was a creative one! It was common to have a huge image there, or some game, something
          outstanding. People got so creative with them, that they even sometimes forgot to place the only important
          thing there - a link to go back to main page.
        </li>
        <li>
          "Welcome pages" on sites! Often websites had a landing page with a link to "Enter this site". In non-english
          speaking countries it was also common to have different versions of the website in different encodings,
          because UTF was not a thing yet, and these landings allowed to select encoding.
        </li>
        <li>
          People used framesets for layout. People used tables for layout. Using divs for layout was a pain, but it was
          elite. At some point there was a belief that search engines favor sites with div layout, so
          <code>float</code> was the only way to do layouts. That is, your sidebar is <code>float: right</code>. The
          floats had to be cleared, and the <code>::after</code> clearfix was not a thing - because we had to support
          IE.
        </li>
        <li>
          "mobile" versions of website were a thing. WAP was a thing. There were no mediaqueries, so the mobile version
          often was a separate website under different subdomain. Also, internet traffic was way more expensive, so the
          modern approach to serve a 1.5mb webpage and just have its CSS to adjust to small screen was not viable.
        </li>
        <li>
          A lot of "dynamic" stuff was done using jQuery. Things that are nowadays done using CSS only. There were
          websites like <a href="http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex3/">Dynamic drive</a>, that hosted easily
          pluggable javascripts for your website. You simply downloaded it and plugged, there were no package control
          and no bundlers. It was common to add mouse trails, snowflakes and other silly things to websites, even the
          "serious", corporate ones.
        </li>
        <li>
          There was no such a thing as "web apps". There was no concept of a "single-page application". "Web apps" were
          either java applets or flash. JavaScript was mainly used to pop-up menus and whatnot. HTML4 was the main
          thing, if you wanted something fancy and visual - it was the pain. People used to call it "DHTML". And it was
          often broken! - just because you had an unsupported browser, or the developer had a rough day, or you had JS
          disabled.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Despite all the limitations and quirks, being a developer just sparked joy. In order to do even most basic
        things one had to learn and "be on a bleeding edge" of things. It involved a lot of experimentation, weirdest
        challenges and required creativity first of all. The web was not "yet another platform" back then, and users
        were not treated as "products". Expectations were lower, technologies were simpler. It was a frontier, wild
        west, and it was fun.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, it still IS fun today. But different kind of fun, more "mature" kind of fun.</p>
