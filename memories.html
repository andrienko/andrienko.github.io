      <p>Couple memories of the old web. It was horrible but majestic at the same time.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          My first "serious" IDE for the web was something called Aptana - basically an Eclipse with some cool additions
          for web development. It had its own JRE in a folder - I could just put it on my 2GB USB flash drive and use it
          everywhere without installing Java. Big deal. On a flash drive it was next to my manually configured
          "portable" Apache, and a portable version of Chrome.
        </li>
        <li>
          All one had to do to deploy a website is upload the updated files via FTP. Fancy IDEs had FTP built in - one
          just had to click a button to sync with an FTP. There was no CI/CD, no one used VCS. Later, SVN prevailed.
        </li>
        <li>
          There was no such thing as Developer Tools. So people used FireBug back then. In Opera I used FireBug Lite,
          that loaded via bookmarklet. In order to debug CSS blocks - I used to write
          <code>*{ border: 1px solid red; }</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Usually, what came from a designer was either a single PSD file, or even a JPEG. Often had to slice them. If
          the designer was tech-savvy - the design was in and HTML table. And it was times when everyone already
          hesitated to use table layouts. A "markup guy" was a thing, "javascript developer" was not.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>float</code> was the only way to do layouts. Imagine entire page layout done with float. That is, your
          sidebar is <code>float: right</code>. The floats had to be cleared, and the <code>::after</code> clearfix was
          not a thing - because we had to support IE6.
        </li>
        <li>
          IE5 and IE6 had support for PNG, but to enable that one had to add
          <code>progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader</code> filter to the image style. And had to do that
          via JavaScript, because that also required the image source.
        </li>
        <li>
          There was times when <code>border-radius</code> was not supported by browsers. Before chrome, before prefixes
          - only opera had it. So to do border radius and a shadow it had to be done via 2 extra divs and 4 images.
          <code>border-image</code> was not a thing either.
        </li>
        <li>
          There was no such a thing as "web apps". There was no concept of a "single-page application". "Web apps" were
          either java applets or flash. JavaScript was mainly used to pop-up menus and whatnot. HTML4 was the main
          thing, if you wanted something fancy and visual - it was the pain. People used to call it "DHTML".
        </li>

        <li>
          It was typical to write your own CMS. On free-lance market everyone had his own CMS, at least. I preferred
          using plain text files to store data - so my CMS did not require a database.
        </li>
        <li>
          XSS was a thing. It still is, but web is a way safer place now. Everything had to be done with meticulous
          care. Sanitizing input for databases was not a common thing - there were no prepared statements. CORS was not
          a thing, too. JSONP was.
